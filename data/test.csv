I'm walking my way, I'm walking my way
I'm taking a step closer every day
I'm climbing my way, I can't feel the pain
Don't know where the end is, so I can not stop this
I'm not gonna stay where I am, don't stop and I never look back
So steep but I don't care about that, going up this highway, fast track
I don't think about giving up, I'll never tap outta this
It's a long way down, a cliffhanger but I'm not gonna slip
[Pre-Chorus: Seungmin, 
Lee Know
]
I'm so lonely, falling slowly
When will I stop falling?
I'm fighting through the pain as it keeps getting louder
I'm broken, faded like a withering flower
But in the pouring rain, that's when I get stronger
Push me off again
[Chorus: Bang Chan, 
I.N

I'm falling up, falling up, falling up
And again, I'm falling up, falling up, falling up
I shed my blood, sweat and tears, head to the top
I give it my all, I got no slump
I'm falling up, falling up, falling up
And again, I'm falling
[Verse 2: Changbin,

Fate intervenes and chang–µs everything, I nev–µr change, I just follow me
When I need direction, I take a look inside at my integrity
Go higher, I can almost taste the fire
Gonna light up this tiny spark, unleash my inner fighter (Yeah)
I'm like a winter tree waiting to grow back all my leaves
It's only temporary, you can't keep me from my dream
My shadow black as night and now it's turned its back on me
It's dark up ahead, but it's brighter than what's hiding behind me

(Call me baby) These streets are total chaos
(Call me baby) Strangers in between people (Ha-ha)
(Call me baby) Every time that we're together is like
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom (What up?)
[Verse 1]
Hey girl, that one moment felt like eternity
(The fate-like moment)
When you pierced into me instantly
(Like lightning, in this world)
You called my name and came to me
It's amazing, like a flash of light you fill me up
The moment I see you, oh, my
Sit her–µ comfortably and listen to my story now
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I don't care if I have to go far
By your sid–µ, like this
I'll become the one man to be
Into my dry lips, you
Seeped and woke me up
Time's wasting, girl (So don't wait)
Don't wait too long

There are many who shine (Many)
But look at what's real among them (Look)
Call me baby, bae, call me baby (Oh)

And closes its door for everyone else (Closes; You know I'm here, girl)
Call me baby, bae, call me baby (Ha-ha)

You showed that you believe in me
Even if everyone changes and leaves me
You are my lady
All I need is for you to hold my hand

In that long wait

That the world I am in

I wanted to live with you, grow old with you
Hold your wrinkled hands
And say how warm my life was

It was just one blessing
After that short encounter
You cried like the rain
I wanted to be happy for once
But that made you cry
Forget everything and move on
Because I will go to you
When your breath calls out to me again

I won‚Äôt ever forget
Watching over you, my heart fluttering

I don't like being chased, so I'm telling you upfront
I won't bow to you
Keep watching, every day, they want me to watch

Look, I'm gonna make this simple for you
You got two choices‚Ä¶
Yes, or yes
Ah ah ah ah ah
Choose only one of the two, yes or yes?
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Make your choice, come on, yes or yes?
Since when was I so selfish?
Did I ever want something this eagerly, eagerly?
Everyone, everyone is surprised at how shameless I am
(Come on and tell me yes)
My scenario has become more daring than I thought
I‚Äôd say this plan is perfect, quite satisfying, satisfying
I don't care, I don't care no matter what others say ooh ooh ooh ooh
(You better tell me yes)
I have decided yes!
Now it‚Äôs time to hear your answer
If it‚Äôs too hard, there are examples to choose from
You don‚Äôt have to waste your time thinking
Don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôll choose, so I prepared these options
Choose only one of the two, yes or yes?
Don‚Äôt know what you want, so I prepared these options
Make your choice, come on, yes or yes?
I will say no to your no, is it me or us?
I respect your choice, but reject your rejection
There is only one answer, the choice is up to you
It‚Äôs all up to you
Choose only one of the two, yes or yes?
Do you mean it? (Do not guess)
Are you serious? (Do not ask)
Don‚Äôt give me that unsure side-to-side, I want a sure up-and-down
There's no letters N and O
I‚Äôll erase them from today
There‚Äôs no need to think too hard
The answer is yes yes yo!
You bring out my hidden selfishness
Your eyes and my curiosity about you
Make (make) my heart burning (burning)
My heart burn, burn, burn
(You better hurry up)
To make it simple
Whatever you choose, you will be with me
Though it may seem a bit absurd 
(baby boy, ooh...)
Though you might say, I‚Äôm insisting you 
(whoa whoa)
I‚Äôll make you to never regret
Don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôll choose, so I prepared these options
Choose only one of the two, yes or yes?

I respect your choice, but reject your rejection
There is only one answer, the choice is up to you
Now it‚Äôs all up to you
Maybe not (No! No!)
Maybe yes (No! No!)
Make it more clearly, show me how you feel
Open your ears, don‚Äôt you hear it?
It's simple, Y-E-S, hey!
Choose only one of the two, yes or yes?
Make your choice, come on, yes or yes?

Here is one more, yes or yes or yes?
Take your pick, the choice is up to you

So, it‚Äôs me again? Huh‚Ä¶
Why you gotta be like this?
Forget it
[Verse 1]
If you do it's good, if I do it's done
How can you always say that I‚Äôm wrong?
You always want to win
Tears are your ultimate weapon
[Verse 2]
I was attracted to your confidence at first
But every day I went down on my knees
You magnified even my minor mistakes
And pushed me to the edge of the cliff
Well I love you anyway
That's why I put up with you

Feel like a fool, you gotta know
Why, why, why are you always mad, mad, mad at me?
Can we go back to the way we were?

If you do, it always becomes the right words
If you do, I can never win
Suddenly you become a different person
When we get along, well, I get more nervous
If I do, If I do
If I say something, you always say, ""Let's break up""
So I can't get any closer
Can't deepen my love for you

Your major is saying the same thing over and over
You force me to do things to please you
I am tired of these trials with already known results
I'm desperate to break free
To you, they're just friends
To me, they're jerks who could be flirting with you
Another mistake, if you do it's ok
But if I do, huh
[Veres 4]
I wish you wouldn't go too far but you just can't stop
Now I say in my sleep, I‚Äôll be good
When there‚Äôs nothing to say you always say
I‚Äôm gonna go to bed
Frustrated with no one to talk to
Sometimes I delude myself that I‚Äôm trapped
[Hook]
If you do, it always becomes the right words
If you do, I can never win
Suddenly you become a different person
When we get along, well, I get more nervous
If I do, If I do
If I say something, you always say ""Let's break up""
So I can't get any closer
Can't deepen my love for you

It's up to you if you wanna break up, I don't care
Just do whatever you want
It doesn't matter to me
I'll just go to sleep

Hyeya, won't you say that you're sorry?
That way, someday in the far time to come,‚ÄÖat‚ÄÖthe end of‚ÄÖthe end
This painful moment right now
Can‚ÄÖbe a good memory for us in the future
That will have us laughing while talking
Hyeya, you said it before, right?
That you only love me with the heart of a good friend
And how that would last forever
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't say that ever again
It may have not meant a lot to you
But it's too much for me
This burdensome heart of mine has given you a bit of a hard time
I
'll take a step back, I'll wait for you
I'll stand far away so you can be comfortable
I'm begging to you like this
[Chorus]
Hyeya, how are you trying to leave me?
You mercilessly say goodbye with those smiling eyes
Killing me and taking my breath away
The happiness that melody once gave us is still so bright
Please don't leave me, don't leave me
[Post-Chorus]
I don't want to live anymore, what should I do?
What should I do without you?
It would've been better to live not knowing you at all
How was I to know the sadness would drive me this crazy?
[Chorus]
Hyeya, how are you trying to leave me?
It's merciless to say something such as goodbye
I will resent you for leaving me
Oh, please, oh
Don't leave, Hyeya, oh, oh

Hyeya, you said it before, right?
That you only love me with the heart of a friend

This heavy heart of mine has given you a bit of a hard time

I'll stand far away so you can be comfortable
I'm begging to you like this

It's merciless to say something such as goodbye
I will resent you for leaving me
Oh, please, oh

It's better to live pretending not to have known at all
Because the sadness is driving me crazy like this

At the tip of the sunset that hangs on the buildings, I think of you
Spill out the darkness, open the night

I‚Äôm going to get you, imagining how surprised you‚Äôll be
I‚Äôll going to you, going to you, without a reason, going to you
Spilling out the night, I‚Äôm going to get you

I‚Äôll go to you right now
It‚Äôs too lonely at night
Don‚Äôt wanna press it down so I‚Äôm going to you right now
My breathing is getting rougher, we‚Äôre getting closer
When you said you missed me
My heart got impatient so I increased my speed
Like the rain on the window, you‚Äôre sparkling clearly
All of our stories make us run out of breath
The closer I step to you
My whole world changes through you
I want to know all of your moments
Before that moonlight
I can feel we‚Äôre looking at each other through this door
Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶ Your eyes nose lips cheek
Even if you‚Äôre farther away than the sky
I‚Äôll send my heart to the clouds, on this night with the bright moonlight
The moonlight is rising, I‚Äôm going to you before it‚Äôs too late

Are you ready?
 (Ah)
You attack my heart
You attack my heart
You attack my heart
You attack my heart (
Damn!

[Verse 1]
The day we first met
Inside my quiet heart
As if a new world has opened
Accelerate particularly, move
Even my hidden secrets that only I knew
That mood that i wanted to tell you all about
[Pre-Chorus]
The fact that I took a step
Towards you first
It lets me find myself that I didn‚Äôt even know (Oh)
[Chorus]
Pounding more and more
I‚Äôll give it all, take my heart
Surely you‚Äôre my destiny
It shines fully in my heart
This must be what thrill feels like, darling
Eventually I fall into you
You attack my heart
[Post-Chorus]
You attack my heart
You attack my heart (Ah-ah)
You attack my heart
You attack my heart (
Damn!

This is what ‚Äúfall in love‚Äù is
Dipped you inside my white heart, and made it red
Can‚Äôt stop thinking about you
I keep thinking about you more and more

Like the moon spinning around the earth
We will, ooh-ooh, be seeing each other
On the ooh-ooh-ooh, on the love trail

When I see you, spark
It‚Äôs like there is a spark in my heart
I find my hidden feelings (Oh)

Anywhere anywhere, I think about you
Anytime anyplace, it‚Äôs full of you spreading out
Come a little bit closer to me
If we face each other
Even an imagination feels so sweet

My heart pounding towards you
I‚Äôll give it all, take my heart
Surely you‚Äôre my destiny
It shines fully in my heart

It‚Äôs getting clearer
I‚Äôll give you all my heart, take my heart
Surely we‚Äôre destiny (Destiny)
It shines fully tonight

Thank you so much
Meet someone like you
Country is a person
Always made me laugh
We were in love
We were in love
Thank you thank you very much

For hugging me, who was lacking
I really want you to be happy

Thank you

We're here
No words, just tears
When I see you flowing endlessly
Now i know love
Now I learned to say goodbye
Love you, love you
Always in my heart, always in my heart

A lot of time has passed
When we become dull with each other
I'll think about it just once
I really loved
I was happy with you

I know it will be hard for us
I suddenly became afraid
As we say our last goodbyes
Close your eyes and smile
Farewell came to me
It's over here
I'm standing there blankly for a while
I think it might come back
Now i know love
Now I learned to say goodbye
Love you Love you

When I see you flowing endlessly

I drown myself in‚ÄÖthe‚ÄÖwave of your‚ÄÖloving gaze
I only want your soul‚ÄÖgoing wild on my skin
A flower, a woman in your heart, Rom√©o
I'm nothing but your name, the tormenting breath
Of our bodies in the dark moving slowly
[Verse 1: Ad√®le Castillon]
And at night I cry tears that stream down my cheeks
I only think of you when the days ends, only when
My sad demons fall heavily on me into the endless abyss
Love me so that the roses wither
That our souls sink into deep tears
[Bridge: Matthieu Reynaud & Ad√®le Castillon]
And at night when all is dark, I watch you dance
[Verse 2: Ad√®le Castillon]
I resonate on kisses all down your chest
Lost in the avalanche of my confused heart
Who are you? Where are you?
Through the cries, by the laughter of your startled shadow
I resonate in kisses
[Chorus: Matthieu Reynaud & Ad√®le Castillon]
In my mind everything goes wild, I lose myself in your eyes
I drown myself in the vagueness of your loving gaze
I only want your soul going wild in my skin
A flower, a woman in your heart, Rom√©o
I'm nothing but your name, the tormenting breath
Of our bodies in the dark moving slowly
[Bridge: Matthieu Reynaud & Ad√®le Castillon]
And at night when all is dark, I watch you dance",1

He lives though hardly speaks
He waits for her in front of this photo of way back when
He, he‚Äôs not a fool
He believes in it, that is all
He sees her everywhere
He waits for her, upright
A rose in the hand
Apart from her, he awaits nothing
Nothing around him has any meaning
And the air is thick
The look is absent
He is alone and talks to her often
He, he‚Äôs not a fool

Showed up not even a minute late
Streets erased of footprints
I lie here, fallen to the ground
Time goes by on its own
Without a single apology, yeah

I'm soaked to the bone
Still won't stop (Hey)
Running faster than that cloud of rain
Thought that'd be enough
Guess I'm only human after all
I'm in a world of pain
This cold the damn world gave to me (Woo)

Dancing off-beat lying on the ground
Once winter comes, let's exhale
A warmer breath

Yeah, just one day, one night

If only I had just one day
I want to peacefully fall asleep intoxicated with your sweet scent
If there‚Äôs a chance in my busy schedule
I want to put my body in your warm and deep eyes
I like that, your long, straight hair
Your breathtaking neck when you
Put it up and the strands that fall out
Wherever we go
My handbag is your waist
Yo my honey
Whenever I see you, I run out of breath like the streets of Myungdong
Our BGM is the sound of breathing
Your voice when you say my name
I wanna be locked in you and swim in you
I want to know you more, an explorer venturing through your deep forest of mystery
I appreciate the masterpiece that is you because your existence alone is art
I imagine this all night, every day
Because it‚Äôs a meaningless dream anyway

Just one day, if I can be with you

Maybe you resent me a little or, no, a lot
I know, I couldn‚Äôt look at you more because of my dream
Then just give me one day
Even if it‚Äôs in my dream, just one day
Out of all those words I had to swallow
Because of the excuse of reality
I‚Äôll pick one and tell it to you for sure
Let‚Äôs meet when the morning glory blooms
And part when
 they wither
I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd get over you easily but
Is it selfish of me to hope you are the same?

Whatever you do, it's like cutting water with a knife (Uh)
Our hands are full of a fat check
If you're curious, fact check
My expectations are higher
It's like fish in water
I'm a little Toxic
You've fallen for me, I'm Foxy
[Pre-Chorus: Ros√© & 
Jisoo

Think twice
I can't act nice like other people
Don't be mistaken
I only smile easily for myself
You may not know well yet
If you want, then test me
You're so predictable
If you wanted something easy

Oh, wait 'til I do what I do
Hit you with that ddu-du ddu-du du (Du, du, du, du, du, du)

The path I walk now
BLACKPINK 4 way intersection
North, South, East, West, all ways run it
All of your bucket list, I bought it
Pulling you and pushing you far away
I do it however I want because I'm a bad girl
Whether you like me or hate me or whatever anyone says
When the bass drop, it's another banger
[Pre-Chorus: Jisoo & 
Ros√©

Think twice
I can't act nice like other people

We seem similar, we are different from the core
Even if we're shy, we are the best on the stage
Born skinny, bitch, no matter how much weight I gain, I'm slim
Slow at calculation, but fast at sense
I don't want to talk about popularity, my mouth would only hurt
F boys

Bang my head, bang my head against the wall

Look at me, what‚Äôs the situation?

I see the walls crumbling down
And gradually, dawn is coming
It‚Äôs connecting endlessly
Can‚Äôt cut it off with this dull blade
So the problem keeps repeating

Before I held you, I didn‚Äôt know
That the world I was in
Was this bright
I reached you with a small breath of life
It‚Äôs a love that called out to me fearlessly
[Chorus 1]
I liked it so much
Watching over you, my heart fluttering
Even when I was ridiculously jealous
All of those ordinary moments
In the dark eternity
In that long wait
Like sunshine, you fell down to me
[Verse 2]
Before I let go of you, I didn‚Äôt know
That the world I am in
Was this lonely
Pretty flowers bloomed and withered here
The season of you will never come again
[Chorus 2]
I started to become greedy
I wanted to live with you, grow old with you
Hold your wrinkled hands
And say how warm my life was
[Bridge]
It was just one blessing
After that short encounter
You cried like the rain
I wanted to be happy for once
But that made you cry
Forget everything and move on
Because I will go to you
When your breath calls out to me again
[Chorus]
I won‚Äôt ever forget
Watching over you, my heart fluttering
Even when I was ridiculously jealous
All of those moments that you gave to me
Some day, we‚Äôll meet again
It‚Äôll be the happiest day
I will go to you like the first snow
I will go to you",2

You lick around my ears while I'm asleep, stare
Then you scratch and laugh
Your voice whispers endlessly
Oh you're the bad dream kill
You keep possessing and calling me
To come where you are
Yes, to come to you

Ha! It's enough
All the gibberish on my ear
I'ma let it blow
My five senses are focused on it, on edge
You come in and stir it up recklessly
When I fall asleep with one eye open
You permeate without a sound, the phantom
I'm so sick and tired of it
When the light turns on, I hope you're gone

Before I held you, I didn‚Äôt know
That the world I was in
Was this bright
I reached you with a small breath of life
It‚Äôs a love that called out to me fearlessly
[Chorus 1]
I liked it so much
Watching over you, my heart fluttering
Even when I was ridiculously jealous
All of those ordinary moments
In the dark eternity
In that long wait
Like sunshine, you fell down to me
[Verse 2]
Before I let go of you, I didn‚Äôt know
That the world I am in
Was this lonely
Pretty flowers bloomed and withered here
The season of you will never come again
[Chorus 2]
I started to become greedy
I wanted to live with you, grow old with you
Hold your wrinkled hands
And say how warm my life was
[Bridge]
It was just one blessing
After that short encounter
You cried like the rain
I wanted to be happy for once
But that made you cry
Forget everything and move on
Because I will go to you
When your breath calls out to me again
[Chorus]
I won‚Äôt ever forget
Watching over you, my heart fluttering
Even when I was ridiculously jealous
All of those moments that you gave to me
Some day, we‚Äôll meet again
It‚Äôll be the happiest day
I will go to you like the first snow
I will go to you",2

Songs about love,MIROTIC,181,"[Verse 1: Jaejoong, Changmin, Junsu, Yoochun]
At the beginning, you were sweetly and ordinarily attracted to me
You came up to me and told me it would forever be like that
All of the possibilities opened up, woah, woah-oh-oh
What is love? What is it?
The red ocean is already a modifier
I'm breakin' my rules again, I'm bored, you know?
Even if you get a little bit hurt, it's okay, woah, woah-oh-oh
[Chorus: All, Yunho, Jaejoong]
You want me, you've fallen for me
You're crazy about me, you can't escape me
I got you under my skin (Ooh)
You want me, you've fallen for me
You're crazy about me, you're my slave
I got you under my skin (Ooh)
[Verse 2: Changmin, Junsu, Yoochun, Yunho]
A sharp gaze digs into my head
It's not me, my chrome heart hasn't moved at all
It's what you chose, woah, woah-oh-oh
Flowing through your blood vessels
Are hundreds of millions of my crystals
Finally it has started, the end of my transformation
Isn't this love too? Oh, woah-oh-oh
[Chorus: All, Junsu, Changmin]
You want me, you've fallen for me (Oh, woah)
You're crazy about me, you can't escape me
I got you under my skin (Ooh)

You're crazy about me (You're crazy about me) You're my slave (Oh, ooh-woah)
I got you under my skin (Ooh)
[Verse 3: Yunho, Yoochun, Both]
With one kiss and us being together
Like a sharp edge, you're strongly attracted
Two kisses
It's like your heart that's burning up is about to explode
Yeah, I got you
You know you got it
[Breakdown: Changmin, All, Junsu]
Yeah, woah
Come on, come on
Come on, come on (Woo, hey, hey)
I got you under my skin (Ooh)

I am the sorcerer who controls you in your dreams (Oh, ooh-woah)

My devil's ride, there's no place to hide in anymore (My devil‚Äôs got you, knock down; oh-oh-ooh-woah)
So why don't you enjoy it now? (You know, got you, go down on me)
I got you under my skin (Ooh; you, oh, under my skin)

The alarm goes off, ring, ring-a-ling
Whenever our eyes meet
I notice but just spin around
Yet I keep getting closer I know it's too late
[Pre-Chorus]
In my heart, I already know
Sooner or later, I'll step over the line
I'm warning myself, I shouldn't be doing this
Every minute, every second, my heart goes ahead of me
Out of control

I'm surrounded by that spot, spot, spotlight
As it shines on me, I'm swept into the darkness
I see the end, I know it's not right
I can't stop me, can't stop me
No, woah, woah
Right in front of me, this red, red, red line
Across from each other, you and I exchange glances
Wanna feel the thrilling highlight
I can't stop me, can't stop me

Makes my heart beat every day, It's something you must never know
Then I go on pretending

Songs about love,YES or YES,219,"Hey boy
Look, I'm gonna make this simple for you
You got two choices‚Ä¶
Yes, or yes
Ah ah ah ah ah
Choose only one of the two, yes or yes?
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Make your choice, come on, yes or yes?
Since when was I so selfish?
Did I ever want something this eagerly, eagerly?
Everyone, everyone is surprised at how shameless I am
(Come on and tell me yes)
My scenario has become more daring than I thought
I‚Äôd say this plan is perfect, quite satisfying, satisfying
I don't care, I don't care no matter what others say ooh ooh ooh ooh
(You better tell me yes)
I have decided yes!
Now it‚Äôs time to hear your answer
If it‚Äôs too hard, there are examples to choose from
You don‚Äôt have to waste your time thinking
Don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôll choose, so I prepared these options
Choose only one of the two, yes or yes?
Don‚Äôt know what you want, so I prepared these options
Make your choice, come on, yes or yes?
I will say no to your no, is it me or us?
I respect your choice, but reject your rejection
There is only one answer, the choice is up to you
It‚Äôs all up to you
Choose only one of the two, yes or yes?
Do you mean it? (Do not guess)
Are you serious? (Do not ask)
Don‚Äôt give me that unsure side-to-side, I want a sure up-and-down
There's no letters N and O
I‚Äôll erase them from today
There‚Äôs no need to think too hard
The answer is yes yes yo!
You bring out my hidden selfishness
Your eyes and my curiosity about you
Make (make) my heart burning (burning)
My heart burn, burn, burn
(You better hurry up)
To make it simple
Whatever you choose, you will be with me
Though it may seem a bit absurd 
(baby boy, ooh...)
Though you might say, I‚Äôm insisting you 
(whoa whoa)
I‚Äôll make you to never regret
Don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôll choose, so I prepared these options
Choose only one of the two, yes or yes?
Don‚Äôt know what you want, so I prepared these options
Make your choice, come on, yes or yes?
I will say no to your no, is it me or us?
I respect your choice, but reject your rejection
There is only one answer, the choice is up to you
Now it‚Äôs all up to you
Maybe not (No! No!)
Maybe yes (No! No!)
Make it more clearly, show me how you feel
Open your ears, don‚Äôt you hear it?
It's simple, Y-E-S, hey!
Choose only one of the two, yes or yes?
Make your choice, come on, yes or yes? 
(Oh...)
Here is one more, yes or yes or yes?
Take your pick, the choice is up to you
Don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôll choose, so I prepared these options 
(oh!)
Choose only one of the two, yes or yes? 
(Oh oh...)
Don‚Äôt know what you want, so I prepared these options

Make your choice, come on, yes or yes?

I will say no to your no, is it me or us?
I respect your choice, but reject your rejection

Songs about love,If You Do,221,"[Intro]
So, it‚Äôs me again? Huh‚Ä¶
Why you gotta be like this?
Forget it
[Verse 1]
If you do it's good, if I do it's done
How can you always say that I‚Äôm wrong?
You always want to win
Tears are your ultimate weapon
[Verse 2]
I was attracted to your confidence at first
But every day I went down on my knees
You magnified even my minor mistakes
And pushed me to the edge of the cliff
Well I love you anyway
That's why I put up with you
[Pre-Hook]
Every day, every night
Feel like a fool, you gotta know
Why, why, why are you always mad, mad, mad at me?
Can we go back to the way we were?
[Chorus]
If you do, it always becomes the right words
If you do, I can never win
Suddenly you become a different person
When we get along, well, I get more nervous
If I do, If I do
If I say something, you always say, ""Let's break up""
So I can't get any closer
Can't deepen my love for you
[Verse 3]
Your major is saying the same thing over and over
You force me to do things to please you
I am tired of these trials with already known results
I'm desperate to break free
To you, they're just friends
To me, they're jerks who could be flirting with you
Another mistake, if you do it's ok
But if I do, huh
[Veres 4]
I wish you wouldn't go too far but you just can't stop
Now I say in my sleep, I‚Äôll be good
When there‚Äôs nothing to say you always say
I‚Äôm gonna go to bed
Frustrated with no one to talk to
Sometimes I delude myself that I‚Äôm trapped
[Hook]
If you do, it always becomes the right words
If you do, I can never win
Suddenly you become a different person
When we get along, well, I get more nervous
If I do, If I do
If I say something, you always say ""Let's break up""
So I can't get any closer
Can't deepen my love for you
[Interlude]
It's up to you if you wanna break up, I don't care
Just do whatever you want
It doesn't matter to me
I'll just go to sleep
[Pre-Hook]
Every day, every night
Feel like a fool, you gotta know
Why, why, why are you always mad, mad, mad at me?
Can we go back to the way we were?
[Hook]
If you do, it always becomes the right words
If you do, I can never win
Suddenly you become a different person
When we get along, well, I get more nervous
If I do, If I do
If I say something, you always say ""Let's break up""
So I can't get any closer
Can't deepen my love for you",5

Take a deep breath
Until both sides of your heart get numb
Until it hurts a little
Let out your breath even more
Until you feel
Like there's nothing left inside
[Refrain]
It's alright if you run out of breath
No one will blame you
It's okay to make mistakes sometimes
Because anyone can do so
Although saying ""It's alright"" is comforting
They're just words
[Chorus]
Someone's breath, that heavy breath
How can I see through that?
Though I can't understand your breath
It's alright, I'll hold you
[Refrain]
It's alright if you run out of breath

Someone's breath, that heavy breath
How can I see through that?
Though I can't understand your breath
It's alright, I'll hold you
[Bridge]
Even if others think your sigh
Takes out energy and strength
I already know
That you had a day that's hard enough
To let out even a small sigh
Now don't think of anything else
Let out a deep sigh
Just let it out like that
[Chorus]
Someone's breath, that heavy breath
How can I see through that?
Though I can't understand your breath
It's alright, I'll hold you

So, it‚Äôs me again? Huh‚Ä¶
Why you gotta be like this?
Forget it
[Verse 1]
If you do it's good, if I do it's done
How can you always say that I‚Äôm wrong?
You always want to win
Tears are your ultimate weapon
[Verse 2]
I was attracted to your confidence at first
But every day I went down on my knees
You magnified even my minor mistakes
And pushed me to the edge of the cliff
Well I love you anyway
That's why I put up with you
[Pre-Hook]
Every day, every night
Feel like a fool, you gotta know
Why, why, why are you always mad, mad, mad at me?
Can we go back to the way we were?
[Chorus]
If you do, it always becomes the right words
If you do, I can never win
Suddenly you become a different person
When we get along, well, I get more nervous
If I do, If I do
If I say something, you always say, ""Let's break up""
So I can't get any closer
Can't deepen my love for you
[Verse 3]
Your major is saying the same thing over and over
You force me to do things to please you
I am tired of these trials with already known results
I'm desperate to break free
To you, they're just friends
To me, they're jerks who could be flirting with you
Another mistake, if you do it's ok
But if I do, huh
[Veres 4]
I wish you wouldn't go too far but you just can't stop
Now I say in my sleep, I‚Äôll be good
When there‚Äôs nothing to say you always say
I‚Äôm gonna go to bed
Frustrated with no one to talk to
Sometimes I delude myself that I‚Äôm trapped
[Hook]
If you do, it always becomes the right words
If you do, I can never win
Suddenly you become a different person
When we get along, well, I get more nervous
If I do, If I do
If I say something, you always say ""Let's break up""
So I can't get any closer
Can't deepen my love for you
[Interlude]
It's up to you if you wanna break up, I don't care
Just do whatever you want
It doesn't matter to me
I'll just go to sleep
[Pre-Hook]
Every day, every night
Feel like a fool, you gotta know
Why, why, why are you always mad, mad, mad at me?
Can we go back to the way we were?
[Hook]
If you do, it always becomes the right words
If you do, I can never win
Suddenly you become a different person
When we get along, well, I get more nervous
If I do, If I do
If I say something, you always say ""Let's break up""

Hyeya, won't you say that you're sorry?
That way, someday in the far time to come,‚ÄÖat‚ÄÖthe end of‚ÄÖthe end
This painful moment right now
Can‚ÄÖbe a good memory for us in the future
That will have us laughing while talking
Hyeya, you said it before, right?
That you only love me with the heart of a good friend
And how that would last forever

Don't say that ever again
It may have not meant a lot to you
But it's too much for me
This burdensome heart of mine has given you a bit of a hard time

'll take a step back, I'll wait for you
I'll stand far away so you can be comfortable
I'm begging to you like this

Killing me and taking my breath away
The happiness that melody once gave us is still so bright
Please don't leave me, don't leave me

What should I do without you?

One year, 365 days, you‚Äôre my one and only in this world
My savior who gave me motive for my music
I leaned on your big flower garden and came up with lyrics
I still remember so clearly, padam padam
Your flower that is in full bloom has 100,000 colors
An infinite and great ring, like Vivaldi‚Äôs Four Seasons
You‚Äôre still a picture that I can‚Äôt even place in my heart
I‚Äôm doubting my eyes, you are my magical queen
[Pre-Chorus: Seungri]
If you are going to leave, I shall let you go
I shall scatter flowers on the path you will take
[Chorus: Daesung]
If you miss me, come back to me
Then you can love me again
Go on this flower road and take a rest
Then wait for me at that place
[Post-Chorus: Taeyang]
I‚Äôll pick a flower and kiss you
Our faces growing red
I‚Äôll make a flower road and prepare
For you to come to me
[Chorus: Seungri, 
Daesung
]
If you miss me, come back to me
Then you can love me again
Go on this flower road and take a rest
Then wait for me at that place
[Post-Chorus: Taeyang]
I‚Äôll pick a flower and kiss you
Our faces growing red
I‚Äôll make a flower road and prepare it for you
So wait for me at that place",2

Are you ready?
 (Ah)
You attack my heart
You attack my heart
You attack my heart
You attack my heart (
Damn!

[Verse 1]
The day we first met
Inside my quiet heart
As if a new world has opened
Accelerate particularly, move
Even my hidden secrets that only I knew
That mood that i wanted to tell you all about
[Pre-Chorus]
The fact that I took a step
Towards you first
It lets me find myself that I didn‚Äôt even know (Oh)
[Chorus]
Pounding more and more
I‚Äôll give it all, take my heart
Surely you‚Äôre my destiny
It shines fully in my heart
This must be what thrill feels like, darling
Eventually I fall into you
You attack my heart
[Post-Chorus]
You attack my heart
You attack my heart (Ah-ah)
You attack my heart
You attack my heart (
Damn!

This is what ‚Äúfall in love‚Äù is
Dipped you inside my white heart, and made it red
Can‚Äôt stop thinking about you
I keep thinking about you more and more
All of my standards are set to you
Like the moon spinning around the earth
We will, ooh-ooh, be seeing each other
On the ooh-ooh-ooh, on the love trail

When I see you, spark
It‚Äôs like there is a spark in my heart
I find my hidden feelings (Oh)

It shines fully in my heart
This must be what thrill feels like, darling
Eventually I fall into you
You attack my heart
[Bridge]
I don‚Äôt even realize how the time goes
Anywhere anywhere, I think about you
Anytime anyplace, it‚Äôs full of you spreading out
Come a little bit closer to me
If we face each other
Even an imagination feels so sweet
[Refrain]
My heart pounding towards you
I‚Äôll give it all, take my heart
Surely you‚Äôre my destiny
It shines fully in my heart
[Chorus]
It‚Äôs getting clearer
I‚Äôll give you all my heart, take my heart
Surely we‚Äôre destiny (Destiny)
It shines fully tonight
This must be what sweet addiction is, darling
I fall deeper into you (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Pounding more and more

When you hear my heartbeat, baby
You give me a new life, you give me a new birth
I feel your heart beat away
I been losing my mind, I been cravin' my shine
I know me before you was a ready-made me
But you designate me and you resumed me
I been calling your name in this universe

Coming across you is like a TV drama created by the universe (Yeah)

Your fragrance still penetrates and breaks me down

What are you doing later this afternoon?
Do you want to grab coffee with me
At a caf√© in front of my house? Oh
[Verse 1]
I have a lot to do, but I can't seem to focus
Ever since the day we first met
I can't stop thinking about you
I can't stop smiling
I keep thinking about your face
I keep looking at the texts
We sent to each other
What do I do?
I must really like you
I am falling for you, I've fallen for you

What are you doing today? It's the weekend
If you're free, and if you want
Why don't we meet up this afternoon when the sun is out?
There's a spot in front of my house

Come and meet me at a caf√© in front of my house

Girl, I can't stop thinking about what you said
You said you want to go someplace quiet
It got me thinking where
I didn't realize how close that spot could be
You worked so hard all week, good job
Now take a break from your hustle and bustle of your work life
A place of comfort is what you need
My time is set aside just for you
[Pre-Chorus]
What are you doing today? It's the weekend
If you're free, and if you want
How about my place at night?
I'm good with whenever

Come and meet me at a caf√© in front of my house

That a lot of things happened
Your slurred tone, your facial expression, and your gestures
It's like that place at that time
It was you who said it was okay
You left me saying it was okay
How have you been in that time
I wondered maybe

You haven't changed, you're pretty
It's been a while, except for the awkwardness
How have you been?
Except for those obvious greetings

Turning around [?]

Every day, I think of you
I'm honestly sick
Because you look so skinny
I feel like I've been in a lot of pain
I think it hurts more than me
[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe you've been hurt more
For you to bring out your painful memories to me
Well, I'm just sorry
No, I'm more sorry than saying sorry
I'm okay
[Chorus]
I'm not okay, not okay
You know it hurts, it hurts
If it hurts, it hurts and if it's hard, it's hard
But you know I'm doing it just because

I, I, I'm not okay
Actually you're not okay with me
Hesitating in the carefully held out hand
The gently folded hands are colder than then
It's not warm even after a few minutes

It's okay, it's really okay
I'm okay, not okay
Saying you would leave me would be better
So it's really okay
You are okay, you are okay

Watch your sight, better bring your sunglass

And look down without a care
I‚Äôll pick a cloud to sit on
And might as well cause a ruckus Just for fun

A rose in the hand

If only I had just one day
I want to peacefully fall asleep intoxicated with your sweet scent
If there‚Äôs a chance in my busy schedule
I want to put my body in your warm and deep eyes
I like that, your long, straight hair
Your breathtaking neck when you
Put it up and the strands that fall out
Wherever we go
My handbag is your waist
Yo my honey
Whenever I see you, I run out of breath like the streets of Myungdong
Our BGM is the sound of breathing
Your voice when you say my name
I wanna be locked in you and swim in you
I want to know you more, an explorer venturing through your deep forest of mystery
I appreciate the masterpiece that is you because your existence alone is art
I imagine this all night, every day
Because it‚Äôs a meaningless dream anyway

Out of all those words I had to swallow
Because of the excuse of reality

Let‚Äôs meet when the morning glory blooms
And part when

The beat slips away little by little
I can't put on an easy face
I keep forgetting familiar lyrics
There's nothing going my way
Yes, it's all in the past
Even talking to myself, it's not easy
Is it my fault? Is it my wrong?
Only my echo comes back with no answer

Come home and lie in bed
Thinking if it was my fault?
Dizzy night, looking at the clock
Soon it will be midnight

Will something be different?
It won't be something like that
But this day will be over
When the minute and second hands overlap
The world holds its breath for a little while
Zero o'clock

Hoping that tomorrow I'll laugh more, for me

May a new song begin
Hoping that I'll be a little happier, yeah

And give myself a pat today, as well

Hold your wrinkled hands
And say how warm my life was

But that made you cry
Forget everything and move on

When you pierced into me instantly

In that long wait
Like sunshine, you fell down to me

That the world I am in

I wanted to live with you, grow old with you
Hold your wrinkled hands
And say how warm my life was

It was just one blessing
After that short encounter
You cried like the rain
I wanted to be happy for once
But that made you cry
Forget everything and move on
Because I will go to you
When your breath calls out to me again

I won‚Äôt ever forget
Watching over you, my heart fluttering

Make your choice, come on, yes or yes?

I will say no to your no, is it me or us?
I respect your choice, but reject your rejection

There is only one answer, the choice is up to you
It‚Äôs all up to you

Choose only one of the two, yes or yes?",4

So, it‚Äôs me again? Huh‚Ä¶
Why you gotta be like this?
Forget it
[Verse 1]
If you do it's good, if I do it's done
How can you always say that I‚Äôm wrong?
You always want to win
Tears are your ultimate weapon
[Verse 2]
I was attracted to your confidence at first
But every day I went down on my knees
You magnified even my minor mistakes
And pushed me to the edge of the cliff
Well I love you anyway
That's why I put up with you
[Pre-Hook]
Every day, every night
Feel like a fool, you gotta know
Why, why, why are you always mad, mad, mad at me?
Can we go back to the way we were?
[Chorus]
If you do, it always becomes the right words
If you do, I can never win
Suddenly you become a different person
When we get along, well, I get more nervous
If I do, If I do
If I say something, you always say, ""Let's break up""
So I can't get any closer
Can't deepen my love for you
[Verse 3]
Your major is saying the same thing over and over
You force me to do things to please you
I am tired of these trials with already known results
I'm desperate to break free
To you, they're just friends
To me, they're jerks who could be flirting with you
Another mistake, if you do it's ok
But if I do, huh
[Veres 4]
I wish you wouldn't go too far but you just can't stop
Now I say in my sleep, I‚Äôll be good
When there‚Äôs nothing to say you always say
I‚Äôm gonna go to bed
Frustrated with no one to talk to
Sometimes I delude myself that I‚Äôm trapped
[Hook]
If you do, it always becomes the right words
If you do, I can never win
Suddenly you become a different person
When we get along, well, I get more nervous
If I do, If I do
If I say something, you always say ""Let's break up""
So I can't get any closer
Can't deepen my love for you
[Interlude]
It's up to you if you wanna break up, I don't care
Just do whatever you want
It doesn't matter to me
I'll just go to sleep

Feel like a fool, you gotta know
Why, why, why are you always mad, mad, mad at me?

Let out your breath even more
Until you feel
Like there's nothing left inside

Hyeya, won't you say that you're sorry?
That way, someday in the far time to come,‚ÄÖat‚ÄÖthe end of‚ÄÖthe end
This painful moment right now
Can‚ÄÖbe a good memory for us in the future
That will have us laughing while talking
Hyeya, you said it before, right?
That you only love me with the heart of a good friend
And how that would last forever
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't say that ever again
It may have not meant a lot to you
But it's too much for me
This burdensome heart of mine has given you a bit of a hard time
I
'll take a step back, I'll wait for you
I'll stand far away so you can be comfortable
I'm begging to you like this
[Chorus]
Hyeya, how are you trying to leave me?
You mercilessly say goodbye with those smiling eyes
Killing me and taking my breath away
The happiness that melody once gave us is still so bright
Please don't leave me, don't leave me
[Post-Chorus]
I don't want to live anymore, what should I do?
What should I do without you?
It would've been better to live not knowing you at all
How was I to know the sadness would drive me this crazy?
[Chorus]
Hyeya, how are you trying to leave me?
It's merciless to say something such as goodbye
I will resent you for leaving me
Oh, please, oh
Don't leave, Hyeya, oh, oh

Hyeya, you said it before, right?
That you only love me with the heart of a friend

This heavy heart of mine has given you a bit of a hard time

I'll stand far away so you can be comfortable
I'm begging to you like this

Hyeya, how are you trying to leave me?
It's merciless to say something such as goodbye
I will resent you for leaving me
Oh, please, oh

It's better to live pretending not to have known at all
Because the sadness is driving me crazy like this

When you said you missed me
My heart got impatient so I increased my speed
Like the rain on the window, you‚Äôre sparkling clearly
All of our stories make us run out of breath
The closer I step to you
My whole world changes through you
I want to know all of your moments
Before that moonlight
I can feel we‚Äôre looking at each other through this door
Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶ Your eyes nose lips cheek
Even if you‚Äôre farther away than the sky
I‚Äôll send my heart to the clouds, on this night with the bright moonlight

Not what I hoped, they live so happily, just as I want, huh

It‚Äôs like there is a spark in my heart
I find my hidden feelings (Oh)

Anywhere anywhere, I think about you
Anytime anyplace, it‚Äôs full of you spreading out
Come a little bit closer to me
If we face each other
Even an imagination feels so sweet
[Refrain]
My heart pounding towards you
I‚Äôll give it all, take my heart
Surely you‚Äôre my destiny
It shines fully in my heart
[Chorus]
It‚Äôs getting clearer
I‚Äôll give you all my heart, take my heart
Surely we‚Äôre destiny (Destiny)
It shines fully tonight
This must be what sweet addiction is, darling
I fall deeper into you (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Pounding more and more
I‚Äôll give it all, take my heart
Surely you‚Äôre my destiny
It shines fully in my heart (Take my, take my heart)

Yeah, yeah
Buzzing sound

[Verse 1: Taehyun, 
Huening Kai
]
Baby, I just wanted to be
Wanted to be hot stuff (You know?)
Party every day, like the weekend
Raise the volume, as if I am fish that met the water (Higher)
At the end of the day, feed is a disaster
Last night was overflowing with filters
 (Ah)
Momentarily let out a sigh
I know that I can't be a rockstar
[Pre-Chorus: Beomgyu, 
Soobin
]
Even if I cover my ears, the daze gets louder
The empty sound is deafening
As if submerged in a fishbowl, the bruises and tinnitus fills it up
In the empty noise, feel so lonely
[Chorus: Taehyun, 
Yeonjun
, 
Soobin
, 
Huening Kai
]
Rockstar minus the star
Just a rock, okay?
I had a dream
Without knowing anything
A noisy dawn
But a void at the end
Tinnitus filling my ears
It's deafening as if I am locked inside
[Post-Chorus: Taehyun, 
Yeonjun
]
Yeah, I want it, want it, want it
Want it, want it, want it, yeah
I'm just lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, yeah
Just a rock
[Verse 2: Beomgyu,

I don't have that kind of talent
Deep story
I admit it, I'm not a ""born to be""
Even when I see myself, I know I am nothing special
My twinkling dream
It's been long since it faded away
Waiting for every second
I want to become a rock
[Pre-Chorus: Huening Kai, 
Beomgyu
]
After the party, the daze got louder
The empty sound, stuff my ears
As if submerged in a fishbowl, the bruises and tinnitus fills it up
In the empty noise, feel so lonely
[Chorus: Taehyun, 
Yeonjun
, 
Soobin
, 
Huening Kai
]
Wanna live a new life
But I'm a bit lazy
What is my existence?
Give me an answer
I think being a rock
I think it would good
Just rolling around
My own rock 'n' roll
[Post-Chorus: Taehyun, 
Yeonjun
, 
Huening Kai
]
Yeah, I want it, want it, want it
Want it, want it, want it, yeah
I just rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', yeah
Just a rock
Want it, want it, want it
Want it, want it, yeah
I just rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', yeah
Just a rock",4

Songs suitable for happy mood,Love Story,418,"[Verse 1]
A soul in woe
He lives though hardly speaks
He waits for her in front of this photo of way back when
He, he‚Äôs not a fool
He believes in it, that is all
He sees her everywhere
He waits for her, upright
A rose in the hand
Apart from her, he awaits nothing
Nothing around him has any meaning
And the air is thick
The look is absent
He is alone and talks to her often
He, he‚Äôs not a fool
He loves her, that's all
He sees her everywh–µre
He waits for her, upright
Upright, a ros–µ in the hand
No, nothing holds him back, no more
[Chorus]
In his love story
In his love story
In his love story
His love story
[Verse 2]
Hold my hand
Promise me that everything will be fine
Hold me tight
Next to you, I dream still
Yes, yes, I intend to stay
But I forgot how to love
I've been too stupid
Please, stop
Stop, as I am regret
No, I did not want all this
I will be rich
And I'll offer you all my gold
And if you don't care
I'll be waiting for you in the harbor
If you ignore me
I will offer you the last gasp of life
[Chorus]
In my love story
In my love story
In my love story
My love story
[Verse 3]
One candle
Can illuminate the night
One smile
Can build an entire empire
And there is you
And there is me
And no one believes it
But love makes a king out of a lunatic
And if you ignore me
I'd fight again and again
[Chorus]
This is your love story
This is your love story
It's the tale of a life
Love story
[Outro]
Shouts of joy
A few tears, we're on our way
We live in this love story
Love story, love story, love story",3
